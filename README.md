# React + Vite Weekday Kabir Seth

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


to start file locally cd into weekday and run command "npm run dev" this should start the file in your local computer 

I had a lot of fun doing this and would be very excited if I could be considered for this job. After checking out weekday on linkedin I think your product is really amazing and would love to be a part of your team. 

I do hope you like this react webpage as much as i enjoyed creating it.
